Implementation of Polynomial Regression in Python

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x)

#### Why Polynomial Regression:

    There are some relationships that a researcher will hypothesize is curvilinear. Clearly, such type of cases will include a polynomial term.
    Inspection of residuals. If we try to fit a linear model to curved data, a scatter plot of residuals (Y axis) on the predictor (X axis) will have patches of many positive residuals in the middle. Hence in such situation it is not appropriate.
    An assumption in usual multiple linear regression analysis is that all the independent variables are independent. In polynomial regression model, this assumption is not satisfied.
#### Advantages of using Polynomial Regression:

    Broad range of function can be fit under it.
    Polynomial basically fits wide range of curvature.
    Polynomial provides the best approximation of the relationship between dependent and independent variable.

#### Disadvantages of using Polynomial Regression

    These are too sensitive to the outliers.
    The presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of a nonlinear analysis.
    In addition there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression.
